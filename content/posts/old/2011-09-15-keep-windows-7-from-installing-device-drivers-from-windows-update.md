I find a very annoying feature of Windows 7 is every device you install by default searches windows update. This makes installing devices a lot longer than it needs to be. Follow these steps to make windows search your computer first and then Windows Update if needed.<!--more-->

1. Right Click My Computer from Start Menu and select &#8220;Properties&#8221;
  
2. Click &#8220;Advanced System Settings&#8221;
  
3. Select Hardware Tab, and click &#8220;Device Installation Settings&#8221;
  
4. Highlight &#8220;No, Let me choose what to do&#8221;
  
4a. Also, &#8220;Install driver software from Windows Update if it is not found on my computer&#8221;

Save Changes and you are done. You now install devices at lightning speed!
